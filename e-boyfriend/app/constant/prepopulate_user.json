    {"text": "Your response was good! To enhance it, consider aligning it more with your partner’s persona by using specific shared experiences or inside jokes. Try to simplify the language to sound more casual and relatable, just like you would in daily conversations.

Think about these aspects for your revision!", "label": "no"},
    {"text": "The response is already warm and engaging, but to really resonate with Thong’s persona, it could be more tailored or include specific interests.

Suggest including an emotional reaction related to their plans for extra connection. Overall, good job!", "label": "no"},

    {"text": "The response was good in conveying warmth and affection, but to better align with the partner's persona, it could benefit from adding specific memories or inside jokes.
